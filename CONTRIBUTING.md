## Community
The code serves as a template from which to apply the LH* test statistics and multicomponent LH checkerboard analysis to APT data. This powerful non-parametric statistical approach enables the user to determine if solute non-randomness (such as clustering) is occurring within their multicomponent APT data before going ahead with a clustering analysis (such as Dmax or corelinakge). Please feel free to use and modify the code as you wish for your APT analysis.
